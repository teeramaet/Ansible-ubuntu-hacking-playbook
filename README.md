# Ansible-ubuntu-hacking-playbook
This repository has the setup instructions and scripts I use for my daily Capture the Flag (CTF) environment on Ubuntu.
# Why Ubuntu?
Ubuntu was the first Linux distro I ever used, and I’ve loved it ever since. It’s simple, flexible, and just works for me. For my CTF challenges, I prefer Ubuntu over Kali because I can pick and choose the tools I actually need, without all the extra stuff that comes with Kali.

Plus, setting everything up on Ubuntu gives me a great excuse to practice my Ansible skills. Automating the setup with Ansible makes sure everything is consistent, lightweight, and easy to manage.
